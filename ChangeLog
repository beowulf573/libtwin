2004-09-26  Keith Packard  <keithp@keithp.com>

	* twin_convolve.c: (_twin_subpath_convolve):
	Eliminate special case for closed paths.  Just draw caps at
	both ends and accept that the resulting path isn't minimal
	in all cases.  This eliminates the weird results from said
	attempted minimal path with large pens and small curves.
	It also eliminated a lot of extra code from this function.
	
	* twin_font.c: (twin_path_ucs4):
	Fix font baseline value (should be 9).  Take pen size
	into account when computing positions so that glyphs rest
	on the baseline instead of painting on top of it.

	* xtwin.c: (main):
	Show baseline in huge text sample

	* twin.h:
	* twin_convolve.c: (_twin_path_leftpoint), (_twin_path_step),
	(_twin_subpath_convolve):
	Hmm.  Not sure this is right, but I'm giving it a try.
	Recognize closed paths and attempt to construct two
	disjoint paths as their convolution with the pen.  This
	appears to break when the path has a radius of curvature smaller
	than the radius of the pen.  I'm committing it to CVS mostly
	so I don't lose the code; I will shortly commit a patch which
	eliminates the check for a closed path.

	Oh, one correct change is to _twin_path_leftpoint which used
	to try to be clever about point selection.  Now that pens are
	forced to be convex, the correct point to use is the one furthest
	from the line.
	
	* twin_path.c: (twin_path_fill), (twin_path_append):
	Ignore subpaths containing a single point.
	Add 'twin_path_append' to glue one path into another.

	* twin_poly.c: (_twin_edge_build), (_twin_edge_fill):
	Add debug output that shows vertices of polygons
	
	* xtwin.c: (main):
